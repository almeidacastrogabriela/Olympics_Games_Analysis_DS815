### 📍Files Info:
In this repository it's possible to find:
- English version of the project (to be included)
- Portuguese version of the project

### 🖥️ Concepts:
- Setting up the analysis.

- Reading the database

- Data manipulation using Pandas.

- Numpy.

- Generating graphs with Plotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📢 **Curiosity**: Different visualization libraries could be used to assess the information observed at the database. This team decided to do further analysis to understand one of the metrics presented, highlighting the Olympic Boycott that happened in 1980, as well as the Female participation throughout the years leading to IOC's Decision on Gender Equality for 2024.

### 📖 Description
The project consisted into answering the following questions:

Assesing Brazil's Participation at the Olympics:
**Question 1**. Creating a new dataframe containing only the information of brazilian athletes. 

**Question 2**. Possible correlation between an athlete's hight and one's performance at the sport played. Include a gender analysis for the same hight vs performance question.
Generate graphs to complement the findings.
Making the task easier: it's allowed to assess only the sports that have at least 5 winning medal athletes.

**Question 3**. Analyzing the medals brought home by Brazilian athletes. Creating visual representations to demonstrate, by sport, the medal proportion the country has won.
Making the task easier: If you must, exhibit the proportions only for the 6 sports that had the majority of medals acquired.
NOTE: Pay attention! Team sports provide medals to all the players, but must be counted only ONCE!

**Question 4**. Creating a temporal series of Brazilian medals, exhibiting Gold, Silver and Bronze medals in chronological order for each Olympics Edition.
NOTE: Pay attention! Team sports provide medals to all the players, but must be counted only ONCE!

**Question 5**. Choose an analysis considered interesting for this dataset. Implement the necessary visualization and comment the findings.
